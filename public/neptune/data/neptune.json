        "average_celsius": -214,
        "description": "Neptune's frigid temperatures are typical of outer solar system planets, and its distance from the Sun gives it dim sunlight."

      "environment": {
        "potential_for_life": "Neptune's extreme temperatures, high pressures, and volatile materials make it unlikely to support life as we know it."

          "No solid surface",

        "appearance": "Neptune's deep blue color comes from methane in the atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue."
