    "facts": {
      "description": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and has the third-largest diameter in the solar system. It is a cold, windy world with a unique sideways rotation, making it one of the most unusual planets in the solar system.",
      "size": {
        "radius_km": 25559,
        "radius_miles": 15859,
        "comparison": "If Earth were the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball."

        "eccentricity": "Uranus follows a near-circular orbit around the Sun.",

          "rotation_period_hours": 17,
          "axial_tilt_degrees": 97.77,
          "sunrise_sunset": "Because of Uranus' extreme tilt, its poles experience 21-year-long days and nights."
        }
      },
      "temperature": {
        "min_celsius": -224.2,
        "description": "Uranus has one of the coldest atmospheres in the solar system, with temperatures even lower than Neptune in certain regions."
      },
      "environment": {
        "potential_for_life": "Uranus' extreme temperatures, pressures, and volatile composition make it highly unlikely to support life as we know it."
      },
      "surface": {
        "features": "As an ice giant, Uranus doesn't have a solid surface. Its outer layers are made up of swirling icy materials like water, ammonia, and methane.",
        "appearance": "The planet appears blue-green due to methane in the atmosphere absorbing red light and reflecting blue."
      },
      "moons": {
        "count": 28,
        "description": "Uranus has 28 known moons, named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope."
      },
      "rings": {
        "count": 13,
        "description": "Uranus has 13 faint rings, with the outermost ones colored blue and red, and the inner rings mostly dark grey."
      },
      "magnetosphere": {
        "description": "Uranus' magnetic field is irregularly shaped, tilted nearly 60 degrees from the planet's axis and offset from the center. The magnetosphere extends into space in a corkscrew shape due to the planet's sideways rotation."
      },
      "formation": {
        "age_billion_years": 4.5,
        "description": "Uranus formed around 4.5 billion years ago from gas and dust. It likely migrated to its current position in the outer solar system from a closer orbit."
      }
    },
    "namesake": {
      "mythology": "Named after Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode. It was the first planet discovered using a telescope."
